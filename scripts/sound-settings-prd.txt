# Sound Settings Integration PRD

## Overview
Integrate the sound settings feature between the backend and frontend to provide users with the ability to toggle sound effects during gameplay. The sound settings should persist between sessions and be tied to the user's account.

## Requirements

1. Backend should provide REST API endpoints for retrieving and updating sound settings
2. Backend should provide WebSocket events for real-time sound settings updates
3. Frontend should use the backend API to store and retrieve sound settings
4. Frontend should provide a toggle control in the game options menu
5. Sound settings should persist across browser sessions
6. Different sound effects should be played for different game events:
   - Piece moves
   - Captures
   - Check
   - Checkmate
   - Draw offers
   - Time running low
   - Game start/end

## Technical Implementation

1. Create a sound module in the backend to manage sound settings
2. Create REST API endpoints for sound settings
3. Create WebSocket gateway for real-time sound updates
4. Create a sound service in the frontend
5. Create a SoundContext for managing sound state across the app
6. Integrate sound effects in key components
7. Connect the UI toggle button to the sound API
8. Store settings in localStorage as a fallback

## Testing

1. Verify sound settings persistence
2. Test different sound effects for various game events
3. Test real-time updates when multiple clients are connected
4. Test error handling and fallback mechanisms
