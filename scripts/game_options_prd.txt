# Chess App Game Options & Controls

## Project Overview
This is part of a chess application being built as a Progressive Web App. The project is divided into several epics, and we are currently focusing on "Core Chess Game Play" (Epic E1). This PRD specifically addresses the Game Options & Controls feature (F1.5) for Day 3 implementation.

## Feature Requirements
Feature - F1.5: Game Options & Controls
- US1.5.1: As a guest or registered user, I want to be able to offer/accept draws to my opponent during the game, so that I can end the game if mutually agreed.
- US1.5.2: As a guest or registered user, I want to be able to resign from a game, so that I can forfeit if I can no longer continue playing.
- US1.5.3: As a guest or registered user, I want to be able to abort the game before it starts, so that it doesn't count as a valid game.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - Ratings remain unaffected if the game is aborted
    - The "Abort" option is available only before White makes the first move.
- US1.5.4: As a guest or registered user, I want to be able to toggle game sound effects on or off, so that I can adjust my gameplay experience.

## Technical Specifications
1. Game Options Dialog:
   - Create a context menu/dialog UI that appears when the player clicks the Options button
   - The dialog should overlay the current game screen
   - Dialog should include buttons for: Draw, Resign, Abort, and Disable Sound options
   - Dialog should be dismissible by clicking outside or a close button

2. Draw Offer System:
   - Create UI components for offering and accepting/declining draws
   - Implement socket event handling for draw offers
   - Add notification system for incoming draw offers
   - Create confirmation dialog for accepting/declining offers

3. Resign Functionality:
   - Add resign button/option in the game options menu
   - Implement confirmation dialog to prevent accidental resignations
   - Add socket event handling for game resignation
   - Update game state appropriately when resignation occurs

4. Abort Game Option:
   - Implement abort game functionality with proper validation
   - Only enable Abort button before White's first move
   - Add socket event handling for game abortion
   - Ensure ratings are not affected when a game is aborted

5. Sound Toggle:
   - Add toggle button for game sound effects
   - Implement sound settings persistence in local storage
   - Create visual indicator for sound on/off state

## Socket Events
- `offer_draw`: Sent when a player offers a draw
- `accept_draw`: Sent when a player accepts a draw offer
- `decline_draw`: Sent when a player declines a draw offer
- `resign_game`: Sent when a player resigns from the game
- `abort_game`: Sent when a player aborts the game
- `sound_toggle`: (Client-side only) For toggling sound settings

## UI Design
- Options menu should match the Figma design shared by the user
- Dialog should use the established color scheme (dark theme #333939)
- Buttons should have hover/active states for better UX
- Confirmation dialogs should clearly indicate the action being taken
- Sound toggle should have a visual indicator (on/off icon)

## Deliverables
- Game options dialog React component
- Socket event handlers for draw, resign, and abort actions
- Integration with existing game controls components
- Sound toggle functionality with persistence
- Proper conditional rendering of options based on game state
