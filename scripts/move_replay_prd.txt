# Overview
This PRD outlines the implementation of move replay controls for the Clubmaster Chess PWA, allowing players to navigate through past moves in a game. This feature enables players to review and analyze their games by rewinding and forwarding through the move history, with the board and pieces updating to reflect the selected position.

# Core Features
- Move Navigation Controls: UI buttons for rewinding and forwarding through move history
- Move History Tracking: Maintaining a record of all moves played in the game
- Board State Synchronization: Updating the chess board to reflect the position after the selected move
- Visual Indicators: Highlighting the current move position in the game history

# User Experience
The move replay controls provide an intuitive way for users to:
- Review their games move by move
- Analyze specific positions during or after a game
- Learn from their play by seeing the progression of the game
- Easily navigate through long games without losing track of the position

# Technical Architecture
## Move Replay System
- UI Components:
  - Control buttons (back/forward) in the footer of the board display
  - Move counter to show current position in the move history
  - Optional move list display showing algebraic notation

- State Management:
  - Move history array storing complete game record
  - Current move index tracking position in history
  - Board position state for each move in the history

- Board Synchronization:
  - Position rendering based on the selected move
  - Highlights for the last move made (from/to squares)

## Implementation Details
- Data Structures:
  - Move object structure: { from: string, to: string, piece: PieceType, capture?: PieceType, check?: boolean, checkmate?: boolean, promotion?: PieceType, notation: string }
  - Game history: Array of move objects

- UI Features:
  - Back button to return to previous move
  - Forward button to advance to next move
  - First/Last buttons to jump to beginning/end of game (optional)
  - Move number indicator showing position in game (e.g., "Move 5/20")

# Development Roadmap
## Phase 1: Core Replay Controls
- Create UI layout for replay control buttons in the footer
- Implement back/forward button components
- Add event handlers for button clicks
- Create move history state management

## Phase 2: Move History Tracking
- Implement data structure for move history
- Add functions to record moves
- Create current position tracker
- Implement board position generation for each move

## Phase 3: Board State Synchronization
- Connect replay controls to board state
- Implement board update on move navigation
- Add visual indicators for current position
- Create move highlight system for last move

## Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Add algebraic notation display for moves
- Implement jump-to-position functionality
- Add first/last move navigation buttons
- Create animated transitions between positions

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. Create UI components for replay controls
2. Implement move history data structure and state management
3. Connect controls to history navigation
4. Update chess board state based on selected move
5. Add move position indicators and highlights
6. Implement optional advanced features

# Risks and Mitigations
## Technical Challenges
- Risk: Complex board state management might lead to rendering errors
  Mitigation: Use a proven chess logic library or carefully test each board position

- Risk: Performance issues with large move histories
  Mitigation: Use efficient state management and avoid unnecessary re-renders

- Risk: Synchronization issues between move history and board display
  Mitigation: Implement thorough validation and testing of navigation functionality

## MVP Considerations
- Core functionality: Focus on basic back/forward navigation with board updates
- Secondary features: Move notation display, visual highlights, jump-to-position
- Defer: Animation effects, complex analysis tools

# Appendix
## UI References
- Control buttons should match the Figma design
- Footer controls layout should be consistent with the overall app design
- Navigation buttons should have clear affordance for interaction

## User Story References
- US1.4.1: "As a guest or registered user, I want to be able to track all past moves in the game, so that I can analyze the game progress."
- US1.4.2: "As a registered user, I want to be able to replay my completed games, so that I can review and analyze my moves."
