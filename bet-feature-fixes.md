# Chess ClubMaster Bet Feature Debugging Summary

## Initial Issues
1. **Backend Socket Error**: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'rooms')" when sending bet challenges
2. **Frontend Notification Issue**: Bet challenge notifications only appeared on /play page
3. **Game Navigation Problem**: After bet acceptance, players weren't navigated to the game

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Socket Room Management**: Players weren't properly joined to user-specific rooms
2. **Socket Tracking**: No reliable way to find a user's current socket
3. **Event Handling**: Insufficient events for game navigation
4. **Error Handling**: Missing try-catch blocks and defensive checks

## Backend Fixes Implemented
1. **BetGateway.ts**:
   - Implemented OnGatewayConnection and OnGatewayDisconnect interfaces
   - Added userSocketMap to track user's current socket
   - Added proper room joining on connection
   - Implemented convertBetTypeStringToEnum for type safety
   - Added direct game creation for bet challenges
   - Added multiple event emissions (matchFound and bet_game_ready)
   - Added comprehensive error handling

2. **Matchmaking Integration**:
   - Fixed addPlayerToQueueWithoutSocket for offline players
   - Added better logging for bet challenge matchmaking
   - Fixed Player interface property (joinTime â†’ joinedAt)

## Frontend Fixes Implemented
1. **gameApi.ts**:
   - Fixed port configuration to use a consistent port (3001)
   - Removed multi-port iteration logic that was causing connection failures
   - Improved error handling and logging

2. **betService.ts**:
   - Added onBetGameReady/offBetGameReady handlers for the new event
   - Added checkBetChallengeStatus for reconnection scenarios
   - Updated return type to include gameId

3. **match_setup_screen/page.tsx**:
   - Updated to listen for bet_game_ready event
   - Added proper toast notifications using project's useToast hook
   - Improved error handling and user feedback
   - Fixed navigation to game page

## Launch.json Configuration

## Result
The bet challenge system now properly:
1. Tracks user sockets
2. Ensures notifications reach both players
3. Creates games directly for bet challenges
4. Emits multiple events to ensure navigation works
5. Provides better error handling and user feedback
